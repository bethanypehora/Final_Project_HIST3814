He also points closely written pages of foolscap, out that the Quebec Code provides ample means to enable anyone to test the validity >of the Act. If, however, neither the Attorney General of the Province nor any », private individual deems it proper to test the validity of the Act, the Minister per tinently suggests that it is difficult to see what grounds His Excellency should be called upon tojc impel lit gation on the result of which no right of the Dominion would depend. The minister's reply shows that in refusing to refer the question to the Supreme Court the Government of the Dominion do so simply because the reference under the circumstances would bind nobody, no matter what the opinion of the court might be—that in fact such reference would establish a precedent under which the Federal Government might deprive the provincial courts of their functions.

“Leaving the west coast we sailed north ; on our way up we entered Behring sea July 3 ; the weather was dirty from the 3rd to the 10th, when it des red and the canoes went out ; on the 11th the weather was again fair, the fog having lifted ; during the morning we were right among the seals and had every prospect of a good catch.

THE GOVERNOR GENERAL S RE
PLY
Where Money Talks Is at the Pantry.
Commenting on the criticisms which being made of Lord Stanley’s refusal with the petitions that were to him at Quebec recently, the Gazette says -4t If the representatives of the Equal Right association did not desire to learn Lord Stanley’s opinion of the Jesuits Estates legislation and the course of his ministers in relation thereto, why was he asked to exercise prerogatives of the Crown, and to act upon hi» own responsibility Î Every one understands that constitutional usage will not permit of any attempt to affix upon the Governor-General direct (personal responsibility for the public acts of Government, in other words that ministers alone are to be held accountable for the course pursued towards public questions, but the Equal Rights association attempted to set the Jesuits’ Estates question above Ministerial responsibility by petitioning the Gov-General to exercise prerogatives of the Crown. Lord Stanley s courtesy in stating at considerable length the reasons why he deemed the exercise of prerogative rights improper and unwarranted in the circumstances, and the frank recital of the ieasous why he disagreed with the petitioners in their statement of the case for disallowance, merit at least respectful if they cannot evoke com mend-

The Penalties of Fashion.
The “Heavenly Foot Society" has been started In China by the women, in rebellion against the venerated fashion that oom presses their feel.
British reporte of the Inland flsheriee show that ont of 77,870 salmon captured in seven, been districts only 3.744 were taken by the rod. The others wore netted.
The penalties of fashion inflicted on both man and woman are many and severe Undoubtedly woman Is made to Buffer the most because she most often le defiant of the rnlee of health. A perfectly healthy person of cither sex le hard to find, and women who nearly approach the ideal eta# indeed. The alimente peculiar

An agent of th« Dominion Government, who hae been exploring In the northern part of British Columbia, reports the discovery of a tribe of In» lane who have for generations Indulged in cannibalism as one of their •acred ordinances, during what if known as their winter dances.
They are the Teimpeheane, or Kwogntls, and believe that the Hamad tel is a spirit living entirely upon human flesh on the mountains. Many years ago a number of the tribe went into the mountains, acd. having encountered the mythical Hamad tel, became ghouls or Hamadtei themselves.
Their families alone possess the right of becoming initiated by going away, fasting in the woods, to meet the flamadtei. The mils
are also few
to their sex appear to have been quite thoroughly die tribu ted, and but few. comparatively, have been overlooked. Unfortunately women have grown to consider these Inflictions as among the ooneequenoee of womanhood, and unisse very severe they bear them resignedly. No one oan know too much on the subject of personal hygiene : were It proper to make a distinction, it might justly be said of women that they need enlightenment most, rangements, and malpositions have many different causes, but the common cause is undoubtedly to be found in their clothing, or In the wearing of the same. Specialists in the treatment of women's diseases have always vehemently protested egalnet the unreasonable decrees of fashion, but all to no purpose. Being men, women have felt that they oould not judge understandingly, and, hence, have found It easy to believe that their remonstrances were made partly through Ignorance, but largely through prejudice. And so the evil consequences of drees have been multiplied as well a# perpetuated nntâ1 a healthy woman Is a phenomenon. Fortunately for their sex, the number of woman physicians is growing, and ultimately they may work the reforms their opposites have been powerless to effect One thing Is very evident, that not only are errors in dress accountable for many female
., but in each trouble—even which are now treated by the surgeon's knife—hygienic means promise the beetreeultelnway of treatment, But,nnfortu nately, at the present time they are the lest resorted to, and then almost always most reluctantly.—f Boston Herald
