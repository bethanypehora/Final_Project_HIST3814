years agn.
A strong gale had been blowing, and the only wa> the residents could explain the mystery was that tho wind had blown across some lake or stream, whipped up some of its inhabitants, and dropped tli m a little farther on.
Fish epidemics are not unknown. Four or five hundred goldfish, perch, and roach perished in a day or so at the Royal Botanical Gardens, in London, one July a few years ago.
Expert investigations led to the conclusion that the goldfish had been mfooted with a fatal disease by a roach introduced into one of their cisterns.
About the same time two tons of carp were found deed in an ornamental lake at Versailles, Paris. Excessive heat had infected the
water.
Even more astounding was the drama staged in a great London goldfish depot, which contained over 100,000 sound fish. One day, soon after he had shown some foreign trade inquirers over the place, the owner was astounded to find many hundreds of fish dead, and others obviously at their last gasp known treatments were tried but in vain, and it took the whole evening to remove the dead from their tanks.
There are many weird and astounding fishes. A shoal of the ferocious little piranhas, called the "cannibal of the waters," can devour a sheep's carcass in two and a half

He is just a* an age to enjoy the fine sport which the estate offers. A thousand acres of forest provide gcod shooting. Partridge and rabbits abound, and there fs some excellent trout fishing.
Viscount Duncannon has inherited his father's love of the stage and each year finds him taking a more active and more important part in the productions of the Stansted Players, starting with Oheron, the king of the fairies in “Midsummer Night’s Dream” and working up to Prince Hal in “Henry IV." His young sister, Lady Moyra Ponsonhy. has also played her part, one of the most charming being that of a fairy in the former play. The fame of the dramatic group has grown in surrounding districts and parties will come for miles to see their shows. Their last performance, given in January, was a more modern effort and comprised "Tho Younger Generation" and Demand Shaw’s play, "How She Lied to

she said:
“I'm seeing after your mother. She thinks I am your wife.”
Tony laughed.
“Well, she'll very :oon find that’s a lie,” he said brutally.
He tried to push past her, but Ness» held the door.
“No,” she said, “it would hurt ncr to see you like that. She's old. She believes in you, Tony, and if she saw you now she’d know.”
“You mean you are going to keep me from my own mother?”
She tried hard to think. Tony had a right here; it was his home, she also had a right if love could give it to her, the right to protect the old lady.
“She can’t see you like that,” she said. “Tony, you mustn’t. Have you no respect for her feelings?”
“I want a home,” he said grimly. “I want money, food, clothes, can give me all those; that's what I care about.”
“And love?” said Nessa.
“Love doesn’t feed a man.”

“He s my son/' said the little old lady proudly.
“I am afraid that he has gone away. There aren't many opportunities for men here. He ought to make a fortune where h« is, and be hack again in no time." Nessa tried to «mile encouragingly. “I'll get you a cup of tea.”
She brought it and set it before the poor oid lady; then she listened because she had a sick longing to hear Tony's mother talk. Poor little old lady! Rather sweet. Old-fashioned. She wished that she could remember her own mother.
“He liked Ixmdon,” said his mother. “Different from l.ie. I'm simple. Country horn and bred. I have got a little cottage in Sussex, and that has meant everything to me. But, of course, it wasn't good enough for Tony. You couldn’t expect it, eou!d you?”
“I don’t know,” said Nessa.
A cottage in Sussex, a home! Oh, the peace of it! Yet there were fools like Tony who chucked away everything.
“It’s boon a little lonely lately," quavered the poor old lady. ‘I felt that I could not bear being lonely much longer. I thought perhaps I could persuade him to return. I hoped perhaps he might have had a sweetheart, some girl who would come and be a daughter to me. It’s lonely, fur he doesn’t write. Boys don’t."
She sipped her tea, a sweet old lady, a little disappointed with the bargain she had made with life. Nessa put her hands on the table.
“Tony went to Canada," she said. “He sailed six weeks ago, and he is going to do something really fine, I sort of feel it."
“I feel it, tdo,” said his mother; “but Canada is a long way off, and I shan’t never hear from him."

“It seems cruel—hard—I hate the idea. I love her—I don’t want her to die."
He put his arm round her and drew her mouth to his.
“My dear,” he said.

She went upstairs with the breakfast tray, and into the sunlit room. The old lady slept heavily; she was always so tired so very tired.

since Douglas fir established its

It has been explained that nothing like sufficient reforestation is going on to make up for what is being taken out. One way of delaying the evil day of the final disappearance of the mature stands of Douglas fir is to educate timber buyers In the merit of hemlock, cedar and pine— and persuade them to buy more of these woods, matter in which every British Columbia is interested, since the lumber industry is one of the province’s chief Industries.

Forest Products
Ottawa.—The annual value of forest products in Canada Is placed at approximately $500.000,000 by the Canadian Government Forestry Service, and over 200.000 persons are employed In the extraction and manufacture of the products of the forests of the Dominion. Last year the value of these exports was over $291.000.000. There are about 3,000 saw mills and 108 pulp and paper mills In Canada. The saw mills represent a capital investment of $180.000.000 and the pulp and paper mills an investment of $660.000,000. The former employed about 45,000 persons and the latter

The Hour
In every man’s life there come moments when he is called to decide whether to go forward or to stand still. Timidity says:	“Hesitate!”
Prudence says: “Be not too hasty. Take aim!” Self-interest says: “You may hurt yourself; you may run rinks. You may injure your prospects of worldly success.” But con sc'ence says: “The hour has come. Go and do your duty.” and everything generous and noble in the heart resnonds and say, “Amen!”
